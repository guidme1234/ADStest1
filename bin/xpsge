# Script used internally when launching simulations to be run on a
# Sun Grid Engine cluster (similar to LSF).   We to do this because
# jobs submitted to SGE do not have the requisite environment variables
# automatically passed to them.   Parameters to this script are the
# command as it needs to be executed on the execution machine.
#
# NOTE:  this is not a general purpose wrapper script!   It was designed
#        to be used in the context of running GoldenGate simulations,
#        and has been tested for that purpose only.
